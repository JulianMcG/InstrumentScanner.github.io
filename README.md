## üè∑Ô∏è Barcode System - Simple Plan

### What Barcodes to Use

Use **Code128** or **Code39** barcodes - these are standard and work great!

### Barcode Format

Keep it simple! Use this format:
```
INSTRUMENT-NUMBER
```

Examples:
- `TRUMPET-001`
- `TRUMPET-002`
- `CLARINET-001`
- `FLUTE-001`
- `TROMBONE-001`
- `DRUM-001`

### How to Create Barcodes

#### Option 1: Free Online Generator (Easiest!)
1. Go to: **https://barcode.tec-it.com/en**
2. Select "Code 128" as barcode type
3. Enter your code (e.g., `TRUMPET-001`)
4. Click "Generate Barcode"
5. Download as PNG or PDF
6. Print it out!

#### Option 2: Use a Barcode App
- Download "Barcode Generator" from App Store (free)
- Create barcodes on your phone
- AirDrop them to your Mac and print

### How to Label Instruments

1. **Print the barcodes** on adhesive labels (like Avery labels)
2. **Stick them on instruments** in a visible spot:
   - Trumpets/Trombones: On the bell or case
   - Clarinets/Flutes: On the case
   - Drums/Percussion: On the shell or case

3. **Pro Tip**: Print the barcode AND write the code by hand underneath as a backup!

### Sample Barcode List

Here's a starter list you can create:

| Instrument | Barcode Code | Quantity |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Trumpet    | TRUMPET-001 to TRUMPET-020 | 20 |

## üîß App Files Explained

- `index.html` - The main page structure
- `styles.css` - Makes everything look pretty
- `app.js` - The brain of the app (handles scanning, data storage)
- `manifest.json` - Makes it installable as a home screen app
- `service-worker.js` - Allows offline functionality
- `icon-192.png` & `icon-512.png` - App icons (see below)

## üé® Creating App Icons

The app needs two icon files. Here's how to create them:

### Easy Method: Use an Icon Generator
1. Go to: **https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/**
2. Settings:
   - Text: üìπ (camera emoji)
   - Background: Gradient (Purple to Blue)
   - Shape: Rounded
3. Generate and download
4. Rename files to `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
5. Place in the app folder

### Or Use These Temporary Placeholders:
For now, you can skip the icons - the app will still work! The icons only affect how it looks on your home screen.

## üíæ Data Storage

- All data is stored **locally on the iPhone** using browser storage
- Data persists even after closing the app
- **Important**: If you clear Safari data, you'll lose your inventory
- **Backup tip**: Periodically export your data (see Advanced section below)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Camera Won't Start
- Make sure you granted camera permission
- Try closing and reopening the app
- Make sure Safari has camera access (Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Camera)

### Barcode Won't Scan
- Make sure there's good lighting
- Hold the phone steady
- Try getting closer/further from the barcode
- Make sure the barcode is clear and not wrinkled

### App Won't Install to Home Screen
- Make sure you're using **Safari** (not Chrome or other browsers)
- The website must be served over HTTPS (or localhost for testing)

### Data Disappeared
- Check if you accidentally cleared Safari data
- Unfortunately, local data can't be recovered if cleared
- This is why regular backups are recommended

## üöÄ Advanced Features (Future Ideas)

Want to enhance the app? Here are some ideas:

1. **Export Data**: Add a button to export inventory as CSV
2. **Search Function**: Add search bar to find specific instruments
3. **Edit Records**: Add ability to edit past check-ins/outs
4. **Email Reports**: Send daily/weekly reports
5. **Cloud Backup**: Sync data to cloud storage
6. **Multiple Users**: Login system for multiple teachers

## üìû Need Help?

This is a simple, self-contained web app with no database or backend. Everything runs in the browser!

### Common Questions:

**Q: Can multiple people use this at once?**
A: Each device has its own data. For multiple users, you'd need to add cloud sync (advanced).

**Q: What if I lose my phone?**
A: The data is only on that phone. Consider exporting backups periodically.

**Q: Can I use this on Android?**
A: Yes! It works on any modern smartphone browser. The install process is similar.

**Q: Does this cost money?**
A: Nope! If you use GitHub Pages, it's completely free.
